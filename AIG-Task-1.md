# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è AIG Cybersecurity Advisory: Apache Log4j Zero-Day Vulnerability

---

## **Challenge Scenario**

### **Introduction**  
As an Information Security Analyst at AIG, you are tasked with responding to emerging cybersecurity vulnerabilities to ensure the company remains protected. A recent zero-day vulnerability has been reported in Apache Log4j, one of the most commonly used logging libraries. This vulnerability has the potential to impact a variety of AIG's systems that utilize the affected Apache services. In this task, you will review the relevant Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) advisories, identify affected systems, and draft a notification to the relevant infrastructure owners to mitigate the risk.

## **üìö Research Summary: Apache Log4j Vulnerability (CISA Advisory)**  

The vulnerability in Apache Log4j, tracked as CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell), allows attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely by exploiting the improper handling of JNDI lookups in log messages. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous as it enables attackers to inject malicious payloads into log entries, resulting in remote code execution (RCE). Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, and other severe security risks.

**CISA Advisory Recommendation:**
- Update Apache Log4j to **version 2.16.0** or higher, which disables JNDI lookups by default.
- Apply additional mitigations if immediate patching is not possible, such as restricting access to vulnerable systems and monitoring for abnormal network traffic.

**Body:**

Hello John Doe,

The AIG Cyber & Information Security Team is writing to inform you about a critical vulnerability in Apache Log4j, which may affect your **Product Development Staging Environment**. This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell), has been widely reported and can lead to remote code execution through the improper handling of JNDI lookups in log messages.

The Log4j vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious code into log messages, potentially leading to full system compromise. We strongly advise that you immediately update Apache Log4j to **version 2.16.0** or higher, which disables JNDI lookups by default and mitigates the risk of exploitation.

The details of the vulnerability are as follows:
- **Vulnerability:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to improper handling of JNDI lookups in log messages.
- **Impact:** Full system compromise, unauthorized access to data, and potential disruption to services.
- **Affected Service:** Apache httpd, Log4j in your Product Development Staging Environment.

Please confirm that the necessary update has been applied and that any other mitigations, such as monitoring for abnormal activity, have been implemented. If you need assistance, feel free to reach out.

For further information, please refer to the CISA advisory: [CISA Advisory: Log4j Vulnerability](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2021/12/10/cisa-releases-cybersecurity-advisory-apache-log4j-remote-code-execution-vulnerability).

We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

Kind regards,  
AIG Cyber & Information Security Team
