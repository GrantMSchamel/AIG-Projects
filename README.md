## üöÄ Tasks and Deliverables

### Task 1: Cybersecurity Advisory: Apache Log4j Zero-Day Vulnerability

#### **Objective:**
Respond to a zero-day vulnerability in Apache Log4j by reviewing advisories, identifying affected systems, and drafting a notification to mitigate risks.

#### **What I Learned:**
- How to assess the impact of a vulnerability on an organization's infrastructure.
- Best practices for drafting clear and actionable security advisories.
- The process of mitigating risks posed by zero-day vulnerabilities.

#### **What I Did:**
- Reviewed the CISA advisory on Apache Log4j.
- Identified the infrastructure within AIG that could be affected.
- Drafted an advisory email to relevant infrastructure owners detailing necessary mitigations.

#### **Deliverable:**
- **Advisory Email to Product Team**: Alerting them of the critical vulnerability in Apache Log4j and the immediate actions needed.

### Task 2: Bypassing Ransomware Encryption: Bruteforce Decryption Key

#### **Objective:**
Use brute-force techniques to recover the decryption key for a file encrypted during a ransomware attack, leveraging a password wordlist.

#### **What I Learned:**
- How to approach brute-forcing for ransomware decryption.
- The importance of wordlists in password cracking.
- Python scripting for automating decryption tasks.

#### **What I Did:**
- Wrote a Python script to iterate through a password list (Rockyou) to attempt decrypting the encrypted zip file.
- Ensured the script could identify the correct password and extract the contents of the file.

#### **Deliverable:**
- **Python Brute-Force Script**: For decrypting a ransomware-encrypted zip file using Rockyou wordlist.
